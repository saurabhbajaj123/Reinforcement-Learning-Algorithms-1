1) Install libraries - random, math, statistics, numpy, matplotlib, tqdm, time

2) The function policy implements the policy for the agent, where the choice of state-feature representation (sine or cos) can be done by uncommenting lines number 21-22 (for sine) or 19-20 (for cos). 

3) The BBO_CEM method is using early stopping criteria to avoid running for the max number of iterations, you can comment that out if needed Lines (109-115)

4) Main method implements the hyperparameter tuning, currently the hyperparameters are set to a single best value that I found during my experiments, 

5) Main method also runs the CEM algorithm for 20 runs, with the list of top 5 best hyperparameter ranges found and also plots figures for each of them and saves the figure

6) To run the code run the command "python HW2.py" in the directory of the HW file.
